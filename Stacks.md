# Stacks/Michelle's Special Quesadillas
This recipe is entirely original. There are two ways it can be made - as a wrapped quesadilla (or stack), or as a regular quesadilla. The regular quesadilla is faster, easier, and a bit more healthy, however the stacks come out thicker.

## Ingredients
- Large burrito sized flour tortillas (stacks), Low carb white tortillas (stacks)
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 lb Chicken, diced
- 1 Red Bell Pepper, diced
- 1 Yellow Onion, diced
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1/2 tsp Pepper
- 1 tsp Cumin
- 1 tsp Chili Powder
- 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
- 1 bag Four Cheese Mexican Blend
- 1 bag Mozzarella Cheese
- Sour Cream, Guacamole, and/or salsa for serving

## Steps
1. In a large saucepan, heat the oil at medium heat. Add the chicken to the saucepan and cook until all the pieces are almost cooked through.
2. Add the red bell pepper and yellow onion to the pan with the chicken and cook until just tender. 
3. Add the salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, and garlic powder to chicken and vegetable mixture. Make sure the spices are fully integrated and the chicken is fully cooked. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.
4. Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Spray with a generous amount of cooking spray.

#### Stacks
5. Assemble the stacks off the heat by sprinkling some Mexican cheese and Mozzarella cheese on a large tortilla. Add the chicken and vegetable mixture directly on top of the cheese. Sprinkle the top of the mixture with more cheese. 
6. Fold the tortilla one side down at a time, making sure each fold overlaps the previous one. The result will usually be a pentagon shape.
7. Place the stack in the hot greased pan fold side down. Cook for about 3 minutes, or until the underside is golden brown. 
8. Flip the stack over and cook the other side for another 3 minutes.
9. Remove from heat and serve immediately with sour cream and guacamole. (And I MEAN immediately).

#### Quesadillas
5. Place one of the tortillas in the greased pan. Sprinkle Mexican and mozzarella cheese to cover the whole tortilla.
6. Cover half of the tortilla with the chicken and vegetable mixture. Fold the cheese-only half over the chicken and vegetables. 
7. Cook the quesadilla for about 2 minutes more, or until the underside is golden brown.
8. Flip the quesadilla over ad cook the other side for another 2 minutes.
9. Remove frm heat and serve immediately with sour cream and guacamole. (And I MEAN immediately).

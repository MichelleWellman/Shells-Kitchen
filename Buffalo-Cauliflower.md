# Buffalo Cauliflower
This buffalo cauliflower is delicious and versatile. It can be used as finger snacks to dip in ranch or blue cheese, it can be a main ingredient for sandwiches, tacos, wraps or salads, and it can even be used on pizza.

The recipe was synthesized from a few different recipes for buffalo cauliflower, where the finished cauliflower was used in different ways. The 1-1 ratio of flour and milk for the batter is pretty much standard. Most recipes also use garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper to season the batter in different amounts.

## Ingredients
- 1 Head of Cauliflower
- 3/4 Cup Flour
- 3/4 Cup Milk (can be almond milk or any dairy free milk as well)
- 2 tsp Garlic Powder
- 1 tsp Paprika
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1/2 tsp Pepper
- 1/3 Cup Buffalo Sauce 
- 1 tbsp Vegetable Oil or Coconut Oil
- 1 tbsp Honey (optional)

## Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
1. Chop the cauliflower into individual florets. They can be as big or small as desired.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, milk, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.
3. Place all of the chopped cauliflower into the bowl with the batter, and fold until each floret is coated in the batter.
4. Place the battered cauliflower onto a greased baking sheet. For best results, space the individual florets away from each other so that they don't stick together.
5. Bake the cauliflower for 20 minutes, flipping halfway.
6. While the cauliflower is baking, add the buffalo sauce, oil, and honey (optional) to a sauce pan over low heat. 
7. After the cauliflower is finished baking, brush the sauce on to the cauliflower and bake for another 10-20 minutes.
    7. Another option is to put the cauliflower into the same pan as the sauce and toss it around to evenly coat each floret.
8. Serve immediately with ranch or blue cheese. Or assemble the tacos, wrap, salad, pizza, etc.

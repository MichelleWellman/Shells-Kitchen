# Guacamole
I use this guacamole both as a dip for tortilla chips, and as a side for Mexican/Mexican inspired dishes. The original recipe came from a professional source, however I've changed it overtime and made it my own. 

## Ingredients
- 3 Black Haas Avocados
- 2 Plum Tomatoes
- 1/2 Red Onion
- 1 Jalapeno
- 1 Bunch of Cilantro
- 1-3 tbsp Freshly Squeezed Lime Juice
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1/2 tsp Ground Cumin

## Steps
1. Dice the plum tomatoes, red onion, and jalapeno. Mince the cilantro. The seeds from the jalapeno can be kept to add heat to the guacamole.
2. Remove the pit and the skin from all of the avocados and put them in a large bowl.
3. Using a potato masher or a fork, mash all of the avocados until they reach a desired consistency. I recommend getting the avocados to a smooth consistency, as the vegetables become integrated more easily this way.
4. Stir in 1-3 tbsp of freshly squeezed lime juice to the mashed avocado. If the guacamole needs to be preserved for more than 12 hours or so, use 3 tbsp. 
5. Stir in the salt and cumin. Sometimes I use a heaping 1/2 tsp measurement of cumin. 
6. Fold in all of the diced vegetables until they are fully integrated.
7. Serve immediately, or after chilling in the fridge for a few hours.
8. The best way to store guacamole is in an airtight container where the guacamole fills it completely. If you don't have a container small enough, putting in an airtight container with plastic wrap covering the top of the guacamole is the next best thing. Make sure the plastic wrap is completely touching the top of the guacamole.

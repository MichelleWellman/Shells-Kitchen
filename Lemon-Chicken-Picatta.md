## Ingredients
- 1 lb of Spaghetti
- 1 lb Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts, cut crosswise in half
- Salt and Pepper to taste
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 tbsp Unsalted Butter
- 2 Cloves Garlic, minced 
- 1/4 cup Shallots, diced
- 3/4 cup Chicken Broth
- 1/4 cup Dry White Wine
- 1 Lemon, juiced
- 1/2 cup Heavy Cream
- 1/4 cup Capers, drained
- Chopped Parsley

## Steps
1. Cook the pasta according to package instructions.
2. Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Coat both sides of the chicken in flour.
3. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 2 tbsp of the butter. Add the chicken and cook about 5 minutes on each side. Set the chicken aside when finished cooking, keeping it warm if possible.
4. Melt the remaining 2 tbsp of butter in the skillet. Add the garlic and shallots, cooking until fragrant, about a minute or two.
5. Stir in the chicken broth, wine and lemon juice. Cook stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.
6. Gradually whisk in the heavy cream until slightly thickened, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the capers, and add salt and pepper to taste.
7. Serve the sauce immediately with the pasta and chicken. Alternatively: put the chicken back into the pan with the sauce and let sit for a few minutes to let it absorb the flavors.

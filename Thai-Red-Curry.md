# Thai Red Curry
This recipe for thai red curry quickly became one of my favorites. It's a slightly modified version of a recipe from [Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2018/02/25/easy-thai-red-curry/). The linked recipe used chicken, however I prefer to use tofu as the protein. Additionally, I add red bell pepper and bamboo shoots in with the broccoli (come on, it's not curry without bamboo shoots). This curry is delicious with white rice, or rice noodles. The consistency of the curry can be changed depending on how long it simmers on the stove to reduce. Additionally, 2-3 cups of vegetable broth can be added to turn it into a soup.

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 Cups of Basmati or Jasmine Rice
- 1 tbsp of Vegetable or Canola Oil
- 1 Block of Firm Tofu
- 2 Shallots, Minced
- 3 Cloves Garlic, Minced
- 1 tbsp Freshly Grated Ginger
- 3 tbsp Red Curry Paste
- 1 Can Coconut Milk
- 1 Bunch Broccolini, or 1/2 Bunch Broccoli
- 1 Red Bell Pepper
- 1 Can Bamboo Shoots
- 2 Scallions, thinly sliced
- Chopped Fresh Cilantro Leaves
- 1 Lime, Juiced

## Steps
1. Cook the rice according to package instructions
2. Drain the tofu by wrapping it in a towel and placing a heavy object on it for 15-30 minutes.
3. Cut the tofu into slices or strips. Coat the tofu pieces in cornstarch. 
4. Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic to the pan.
5. Add the tofu pieces to the pan and cook for about 5-10 minutes each side, until they're golden brown.
6. When the tofu is done cooking, remove it from the pan and set it off to the side.
7. Add the red curry paste and ginger to the pan, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
8. Stir in the coconut milk so that it's fully integrated. 
9. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook uncovered until reduced and thickened, about 10-15 minutes.
    9. For a thinner curry sauce, this step can be skipped.
10. Add the tofu, broccolini, red pepper, and bamboo shoots. Cook until just tender. 
11. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the scallions, cilantro, and lime juice.
12. Serve immediately with rice or rice noodles.

# Stir Fry Meal Prep

This recipe makes a total of 10 healthy and delicious lunches for the whole work week (for you and a s/o). The whole thing can be prepped on a Sunday and remain fresh and delicious until Friday. Additionally, reheating the meals is little effort, and the ingredients aren't too expensive. The only issue with this meal prep is the time cost. Getting some vegetables pre-cut and eliminating a step in the chicken prep has helped, however the whole ordeal still takes a few hours (with two people cooking).

## Ingredients
### Chicken
- Approximately 3-4 lbs of chicken tenderloins
- 1 cup all purpose flour
- Sesame oil for drizzling
- 6 cloves of Garlic, minced or grated
- 4 tbsp Ginger Root, minced or grated

### Stir Fry (Vegetables)
- 2 cups Quinoa
- 4 cups Water
- 2 heads Broccoli
- 2 Bell Peppers
- 2 Yellow Onions
- 1 package of Baby Bella Mushrooms
- 1 bag Matchstick Carrots

### Sauce
- 1/2 cup low sodium Soy Sauce
- 1/2 cup Chicken Stock
- 1 tbsp Honey
- 1 tsp Sesame Oil
- 1 tsp Rice Vinegar
- 2 cloves of Garlic, minced or grated
- 2 inch piece of Ginger Rot, minced or grated

## Steps
1. Prep the Chicken: Sprinkle the flour on a plate and use it to coat all of the pieces of chicken.
2. In a large pan over medium heat, add in a drizzle of sesame oil, along with half of the garlic and ginger. Add in about half of the chicken, and cook for about 7 minutes each side or until cooked through. 
3. Once the chicken is done cooking, place it in the containers and repeat step 2 with the rest of the chicken.
4. While the chicken is being prepped and cooked, slice the peppers and onions, and cut the broccoli into florets.
5. While the second half of the chicken is cooking, cook the quinoa according to package instructions.
6. Once the chicken and quinoa are done, turn up the heat on the large pan a little bit (it it's not already super hot) and add a drizzle of sesame oil. Add in about 1/5 of the vegetables and cook them until they're just tender, remembering to keep them moving so they cook evenly and don't stick. 
7. Once the vegetables are just tender, add in approximately 1/5 of the quinoa and cook for another minute or two. Transfer all of the contents to a large vessel to be divided among the lunch containers. The stir fry is usually complete after 5 batches. 
8. While the stir fry is being cooked, add all of the sauce ingredients to a mason jar and shake.
9. When all five batches of the stir fry is done, divide all of it among 10 containers.
